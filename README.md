## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
W3Schools, developer.mozilla, Stackoverflow

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
one challange I had when creating this submission was getting back into javascript, I was a little rusty but when I started to code, my previous experience in the language came right back. One other challange i had was coding the timer, I spent a good 30 minutes to an hour just thinking how to do it. However realizing recursion was the way through made the task reachable.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would have liked to code a server to peer multiplayer aspect, however after reasearchign different types of connections you can have. As well as the 
intricies of keeping a stable form of a game state, I was novice to say the least. I would love to ask how the front end handles dispalying such game states
and how it comminuctes efficiently with the back end in a server to peer system.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would definetly clean up my code, It is harder to read, I wanted to make it nice and easy to read. I would also liked to have made a multiplayer aspect, hosting the webserver and being able to handle connections to other computers. I had the ambission to make it almost like draw with friends. being able to send a url and be in the
same game switching every turn of the game.
